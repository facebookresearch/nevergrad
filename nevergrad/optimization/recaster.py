"""
Nevergrad's API provides ask/tell, letting the user run the objective function
in their own way. Some libraries for optimization take the objective function
as a parameter and run it themselves.
This module is a system for adapting such a library to be used in nevergrad,
by running the optimization on a background thread.
The file recastlib.py has some uses of it.
For instructions for doing this for another library, see
SequentialRecastOptimizer.

    There can only be one worker. Each ask must be followed by
    a tell.

    A simple usage is that you have a library which can minimize
    a function which returns a scalar.
    Just make an optimizer inheriting from this class, and inplement
    get_optimization_function to return a callable which runs the
    optimization, taking the objective as its only parameter. The
    callable must not have any references to the optimizer itself.
    (This avoids a reference cycle between the background thread and
    the optimizer, aiding cleanup.) It can have a weakref though.

    If you want your optimizer instance to be picklable, we have to
    store every candidate during optimization, which may use a lot
    of memory. This lets us replay the optimization when
    unpickling. We only do this if you ask for it. To enable:
        - The optimization must be reproducible, asking for the same
          candidates every time. If you need a seed from nevergrad's
          generator, you can't necessarily generate this again after
          unpickling. One solution is to store it in self, if it is
          not there yet, in the body of get_optimization_function.

          As in general in nevergrad, do not set the seed from the
          RNG in your own __init__ because it will cause surprises
          to anyone re-seeding your parametrization after init.
