## Differences

Here are a few notable differences from the paper:

- `F3`, `F6`, `F10`: in the Octave version of the paper, the Ackley function lacks `Â Tosz`, `Tasy` and `Lambda`. This implementation reproduces the CPP implementation, which has them activated.
- `F7`: in both the Octave version and the CPP version, `Tasy` and `Tosz` are missing for the side sphere loss. Since this implementation aims at reproducing the CPP results, it is missing here too.
- `F14` optimum is not specified since it is not straightforward to compute.
