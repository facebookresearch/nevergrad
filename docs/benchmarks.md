# Benchmark examples


The following figures are examples of algorithm benchmarks which can be generated very easily from the platform
In all examples, we use independent experiments for the different x-values; so that consistent rankings between methods, over several x-values, have a statistical meaning.

If you want to run the examples yourself, please make sure you have installed `nevergrad` with the `benchmark` flag (see [here](benchmarking.md)).

## Noisy optimization

Created with command: `python -m nevergrad.benchmark noise --seed=12 --repetitions=10 --plot`

Here the variance of the noise does not vanish near the optimum.
TBPSA uses the noise management principles of [pcCMSA-ES](https://homepages.fhv.at/hgb/New-Papers/PPSN16_HB16.pdf) reaching fast convergence rates. We here compare it to a sample of our algorithms; but it performed very well also compared to many other methods.

## One-shot optimization
### dim 11 & select one feature.

Created with command:

`python -m nevergrad.benchmark dim10_select_one_feature --seed=12 --repetitions=400 --plot`

One-shot optimization is the case in which all evaluations should be done in parallel; the optimization algorithm can only decide, once and for all, which points are going to be evaluated. We consider here

- an optimum which is translated by a standard centered Gaussian;
- 1 useful variable and 10 useless variables (this is a feature selection context as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03200);
- the sphere function (restricted to the useful variable);

we see that

- Quasirandom without scrambling is suboptimal;
- Cauchy sampling helps a lot (though the optimum is normally drawn!), in this feature selection context;
- LHS performs equivalently to low discrepancy (which can be related to the fact that only one feature matters).

### dim 12 & select two features.
We reproduce this experiment but with 2 useful variables:

`python -m nevergrad.benchmark dim10_select_two_features --seed=12 --repetitions=400 --plot`

LHS still performs very well, as well as scrambled methods; Cauchy is not that useful anymore.

### dim 10 & small budget

With all variables useful, the situation becomes different; Cauchy is harmful. Scrambling is still very necessary. LHS (vanilla), which does not couple variables, is weak.
`python -m nevergrad.benchmark dim10_smallbudget --seed=12 --repetitions=400 --plot`

### In dim 4

In moderate dimension, scrambling is less necessary (consistently with theory) and LHS becomes weaker as budget increases (consistently with discrepancy results in https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08481).
The following plot was created with command: `python -m nevergrad.benchmark doe_dim4 --seed=12 --repetitions=400 --plot`

## Comparison-based methods for ill-conditioned problems.
In this setting (rotated or not, ill-conditioned) we get excellent results with:
 - [CMA](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00583669/en/), best on the Cigar and rotated ellipsoid;
 - DE and PSO when there is no rotation;
 - Almost rotationally invariant variants of DE in the rotated case (CR should not be exactly equal to 1, otherwise we stay in the vector space generated by the initial population; this confirms results and explanation in http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~ejmontgomery/publications/2010-07_de_cr_moves.pdf);

## Ill-conditioned function
SQP (which won [GECCO 2015 context](https://www.artelys.com/news/159/16/KNITRO-wins-the-GECCO-2015-Black-Box-Optimization-Competitionperformed) performs great in the quadratic case, consistently with theory and intuition:

`python -m nevergrad.benchmark illcond --seed=12 --repetitions=50 --plot`

## Discrete
The platform can also deal with discrete objective functions! We can both consider discrete domains handled through softmax or through discretization of continuous variables.

`python -m nevergrad.benchmark discrete --seed=12 --repetitions=10 --plot`

We note that [FastGA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03334) performs best. DoubleFastGA corresponds to a mutation rate ranging between 1/dim and (dim-1)/dim instead of 1/dim and 1/2; this is because the original range corresponds to a binary domain whereas we consider arbitrary domains. The simple uniform mixing of mutation rates (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05551) performs well in several cases.
