# Optimization

**All optimizers assume a centered and reduced prior at the beginning of the optimization (i.e. 0 mean and unitary standard deviation). They are however able to find solutions far from this initial prior.**

## Basic example

Optimizing (minimizing!) a function using an optimizer (here `OnePlusOne`) can be easily run with:

```python
import nevergrad as ng

def square(x, y=12):
    return sum((x - .5)**2) + abs(y)

optimizer = ng.optimizers.OnePlusOne(instrumentation=2, budget=100)
# alternatively, you could use ng.optimizers.registry["OnePlusOne"]
# (registry is a dict containing all optimizer classes)
recommendation = optimizer.minimize(square)
print(recommendation)
>>> Candidate(args=(array([0.500, 0.499]),), kwargs={})
```
`recommendation` holds the optimal attributes `args` and `kwargs` found by the optimizer for the provided function.
In this example, the optimal value will be found in `recommendation.args[0]` and will be a `np.ndarray` of size 2.

`instrumentation=n` is a shortcut to state that the function has only one variable, of dimension `n`,
Defining the following instrumentation instead will optimize on both `x` and `y`.
```python
instrum = ng.Instrumentation(ng.var.Array(2), y=ng.var.Array(1).asscalar())
optimizer = ng.optimizers.OnePlusOne(instrumentation=instrum, budget=100)
recommendation = optimizer.minimize(square)
print(recommendation)
>>> Candidate(args=(array([0.490, 0.546]),), kwargs={'y': 0.0})
```
See the [instrumentation tutorial](instrumentation.md) for more complex instrumentations.


## Using several workers

Running the function evaluation in parallel with several workers is as easy as provided an executor:
```python
from concurrent import futures
optimizer = ng.optimizers.OnePlusOne(instrumentation=instrum, budget=100, num_workers=5)
with futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=optimizer.num_workers) as executor:
    recommendation = optimizer.minimize(square, executor=executor, batch_mode=False)
```
With `batch_mode=True` it will ask the optimizer for `num_workers` points to evaluate, run the evaluations, then update the optimizer with the `num_workers` function outputs, and repeat until the budget is all spent. Since no executor is provided, the evaluations will be sequential. `num_workers > 1` with no executor is therefore suboptimal but nonetheless useful for evaluation purpose (i.e. we simulate parallelism but have no actual parallelism). `batch_mode=False` (steady state mode) will ask for a new evaluation whenever a worker is ready.

## Ask and tell interface

An *ask and tell* interface is also available. The 3 key methods for this interface are respectively:
- `ask`: suggest a candidate on which to evaluate the function to optimize.
- `tell`: for updated the optimizer with the value of the function for a candidate.
- `provide_recommendation`: returns the candidate the algorithms considers the best.
For most optimization algorithms in the platform, they can be called in arbitrary order - asynchronous optimization is OK. Some algorithms (with class attribute `no_parallelization=True` however do not support this.

The `Candidate` class holds attributes `args` and `kwargs` corresponding to the `args` and `kwargs` of the function you optimize,
given its [instrumentation](instrumentation.md). It also holds a `data` attribute corresponding to the data point in the optimization space.

Here is a simpler example in the sequential case (this is what happens in the `optimize`Â method for `num_workers=1`):
```python
for _ in range(optimizer.budget):
    x = optimizer.ask()
    value = square(*x.args, **x.kwargs)
    optimizer.tell(x, value)
recommendation = optimizer.provide_recommendation()
```

Please make sure that your function returns a float, and that you indeed want to perform minimization and not maximization ;)

## Choosing an optimizer

**You can print the full list of optimizers** with:
```python
import nevergrad as ng
print(sorted(ng.optimizers.registry.keys()))
```

All algorithms have strenghts and weaknesses. Questionable rules of thumb could be:
- `TwoPointsDE` is excellent in many cases, including very high `num_workers`.
- `PortfolioDiscreteOnePlusOne` is excellent in discrete settings of mixed settings when high precision on parameters is not relevant; it's possibly a good choice for hyperparameter choice.
- `OnePlusOne` is a simple robust method for continuous parameters with `num_workers` < 8.
- `CMA` is excellent for control (e.g. neurocontrol) when the environment is not very noisy (num_workers ~50 ok) and when the budget is large (e.g. 1000 x the dimension).
- `TBPSA` is excellent for problems corrupted by noise, in particular overparametrized (neural) ones; very high `num_workers` ok).
- `PSO` is excellent in terms of robustness, high `num_workers` ok.
- `ScrHammersleySearchPlusMiddlePoint` is excellent for super parallel cases (fully one-shot, i.e. `num_workers` = budget included) or for very multimodal cases (such as some of our MLDA problems); don't use softmax with this optimizer.
- `RandomSearch` is the classical random search baseline; don't use softmax with this optimizer.

## Optimizing machine learning hyperparameters

When optimizing hyperparameters as e.g. in machine learning. If you don't know what variables (see [instrumentation](instrumentation.md)) to use:
- use `SoftmaxCategorical` for discrete variables
- use `TwoPointsDE` with `num_workers` equal to the number of workers available to you.
See the [machine learning example](machinelearning.md) for more.

Or if you want something more aimed at robustly outperforming random search in highly parallel settings (one-shot):
- use `OrderedDiscrete` for discrete variables, taking care that the default value is in the middle.
- Use `ScrHammersleySearchPlusMiddlePoint` (`PlusMiddlePoint` only if you have continuous parameters or good default values for discrete parameters).


## Reproducibility

Each instrumentation has its own `random_state` for generating random numbers. All optimizers pull from it when they require stochastic behaviors.
For reproducibility, this random state can be seeded in two ways:
- by setting `numpy`'s global random state seed (`np.random.seed(32)`) before the instrumentation's first use. Indeed, when first used,
  the instrumentation's random state is seeded with a seed drawn from the global random state.
- by manually seeding the instrumentation random state (E.g.: `instrumentation.random_state.seed(12)` or `optimizer.instrumentation.random_state = np.random.RandomState(12)`)
