# Contributing to nevergrad
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

Whether you want to contribute or not, don't hesitate to join [Nevergrad users' Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/nevergradusers/)


## Our Development Process

To install `nevergrad` in development mode (if you wish to contribute to it), clone the repository and run `pip install -e .[all]` from inside the repository folder,
or `pip install -e '.[all]'` if you use `zsh`. If the install fails because of `torch`, you can preinstall it with the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
and rerun `nevergrad`'s installation.


Most of the code is covered by unit tests. You can run them with:
```
pytest nevergrad --cov=nevergrad
```

You can then run `mypy` on `nevergrad` with:
```
mypy --implicit-reexport nevergrad
```
If you are not familiar with type checking, we do not want it to be an annoyance and you can can ignore errors by adding `# type: ignore` at the end of lines flagged as incorrect.
If we consider it useful to have correct typing, we will update the code after your pull request is merged.
If you are however familiar with type hints, you can check with the strict mode: `mypy --implicit-reexport --strict nevergrad`, but at any given moment all the code is not guaranteed to pass the test (we try to work on it regularly, see #409).

Unit tests and type checks (in non-strict mode) will be automatically run every time a pull request is submitted/updated.

Finally, we use pre-commit hooks to make sure the code follows the same coding style. We currently use Â `autpep8` and `pylint`. To install them, just run `pre-commit install` once, and they will be activated for all your commits on this repository.

## Guidelines

We have added some specific guidelines on how to [add a new algorithm](../docs/adding_an_algorithm.md) which can help you find your way in the structure of the optimization subpackage.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need
to do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style
We use pep8, but allow lines to be as long as 140 characters.
Please use the pre-commit hooks to ensure correctness (see section "Our Development Process").

## Documentation

Documentation can be build with `make html` from the `docs` folder.
